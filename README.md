LiqVib is a liquid sensor for blind people. While most blind people use a finger to feel the liquid rise while pouring a drink into a glass, hot drinks like coffee or tea could be a major problem. There are solutions for this available, but they sound like a fire alarm and will wake up the whole neighborhood. LiqVib is a tiny, extremely low cost PCB solution that replaces this classic functionality with a vibration motor. It's exterior can be 3D printed.  

Cost:
- 2$ for 10 PCBs (You can technically fit up to 8 onto a 100x100mm square, which will basically give your 80 PCBs for 2$)
- 0.5$ for a CR2032 button cell
- 0.4$ for a CR2032 holder
- 2$ for 10 vibration motors
- 0.15$ for each capacitor
- Depending on the shape, a few dollars for having someone print an enclosure externally
