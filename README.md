LiqVib is a liquid sensor for blind people. While most blind people use a finger to feel the liquid rise while pouring a drink into a glass, hot drinks like coffee or tea could be a major problem. There are solutions for this available, but they sound like a fire alarm and will wake up the whole neighborhood. LiqVib is a tiny, extremely low cost PCB solution that replaces this classic functionality with a vibration motor. It's exterior can be 3D printed.  


**Cost:**

- 2$ for 10 PCBs (You can technically fit up to 8 onto a 100x100mm square, which will basically give your 80 PCBs for 2$)
- 0.5$ for a CR2032 button cell
- 0.4$ for a CR2032 holder
- 2$ for 10 vibration motors
- 0.15$ for each capacitor
- Depending on the shape, a few dollars for having someone print an enclosure externally


**Assembly:**

- Order PCBs (for example from JLCPCB.com) by uploading the Gerber files. There is no need to change any settings. Just upload and order.  
- Solder the battery holder to the PCB (big circle)
- Glue the Vibration motor to the pcb using it's double sided adhesive tape and solder the red wire to "red" and the black wire to "black"
- Stick the Capacitor's three pins through the capcitor holds and solder them on
- Remove any excess cable/pins that stick out on the back
- Solder any kind of wire or cable to the two big solder areas on the backside - these will be probes that will activate the motor once they both touch a liquid.
